import java.util.Random

//Generate a random number between 1 and 50 using the following code:
//val random = Random().nextInt(50) + 1
//IntelliJ helps you import the Random class from Java so that you can use it. Donâ€™t
//worry about the details of imports for now.
//Now, use a when statement to switch between the cases where random is in
//the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, or above 40. In each case, print out
//a message containing the range and the exact value of random.
//Test your code in a main() function and run it several times to get different
//random numbers.
